# Real-Time Threat Detection and Mitigation Using Snort IDS

This project demonstrates the use of Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for real-time detection and mitigation of cyber threats based on known vulnerabilities. It focuses on configuring Snort rules, monitoring network traffic, and responding to suspicious activities in a simulated environment.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Deploy and configure Snort IDS for real-time monitoring.  
- Detect and analyze malicious traffic using custom rules.  
- Mitigate detected threats through incident response measures.  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of Snort in protecting network infrastructure.

## 🧩 Project Architecture & Workflow

*Figure: High-level architecture showing traffic flow and IDS monitoring.*

1. External traffic originates from an attacker machine.
2. Traffic passes through the internet, router, and firewall.
3. Snort IDS inspects packets in real time.
4. Suspicious activity triggers alerts to the administrator.
5. Legitimate traffic reaches internal hosts.

## 🖥️ Lab Environment & Requirements

**Hardware**
- Host machine with Intel Core i5 or higher
- Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- Ethernet-capable NIC with packet capture support

**Virtual Machines**
- Snort IDS Machine: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Attack Machine: Kali Linux

**Software & Tools**
- Oracle VM VirtualBox
- Snort IDS (v2.9.20)
- Wireshark
- Metasploit Framework

## ⚙️ Snort Configuration Overview

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS was installed and configured as the IDS host.
- Snort 2.9.20 was compiled and installed with required dependencies.
- Custom detection rules were created and tuned.
- Snort was configured to generate real-time alerts and logs.

Detailed installation steps are available in
