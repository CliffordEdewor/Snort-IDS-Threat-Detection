# Real-Time Threat Detection and Mitigation Using Snort IDS

This project demonstrates the use of Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for real-time detection and mitigation of cyber threats based on known vulnerabilities. It focuses on configuring Snort rules, monitoring network traffic, and responding to suspicious activities in a simulated environment.

## Objectives
- Deploy and configure Snort IDS for real-time monitoring.  
- Detect and analyze malicious traffic using custom rules.  
- Mitigate detected threats through incident response measures.  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of Snort in protecting network infrastructure.  

## Key Features
- Packet inspection and rule-based intrusion detection  
- Real-time alerts on suspicious activities  
- Log analysis for forensic investigation  
- Integration with system/network defense measures  

## Tools & Technologies
- Snort IDS  
- Wireshark (traffic analysis)  
- Kali Linux / Ubuntu environments  
- Custom Snort rules  

## Screenshots & Results
_Add screenshots of Snort detecting attacks, alert logs, and mitigation steps here._  

## Academic Context
This project was developed and successfully defended as a final-year academic project at the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), Nigeria.
